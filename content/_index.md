Hi, I'm **Tim Howard**, a data and strategy advisor based in Melbourne. I work at the intersection of *international relations* and *analytics*, turning complex trade and policy questions into clear, practical insight.

This is where I share notes on *trade, strategy, and technology*, and a few of the things that keep me balanced: *gardening*, *music*, *photography*, *travel*, and *long hikes*.
